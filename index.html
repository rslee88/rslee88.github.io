            Hi! I’m Rachel and I am a first year master’s student in HCDE. I graduated from the UW with a BA in Business Administration and Information Systems. 
                
            I worked for 7 years as an accountant but realized one day that debits and credits were just not my passion. So after a bit of soul-searching and Googling, I decided to pursue a career in UX design and now I’m here! 
                
            I'm very excited for Digital Fabrications!
