            Hi! I’m Rachel and I am a first year master’s student in HCDE. I graduated from the UW with a BA in Business Administration and Information Systems. 
                
            I worked for 7 years as an accountant but realized one day that debits and credits were just not my passion. So after a bit of soul-searching and Googling, I decided to pursue a career in UX design and now I’m here! 
                
            I'm very excited for Digital Fabrications, and am especially looking forward to learning how to modeling with CAD tools.
                
            I'm not sure how much I'll be able to help my peers, but do I know how to do a bit of web design with HTML & CSS. I'm probably going to be doing more learning than anything else!
